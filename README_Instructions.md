# Speech-to-text-using-IBM-Watson
Easy way to convert audio file to text! 

Step 1 (Anaconda). Install Anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads

Step 2 (IBM Cloud). Sign up for IBM Cloud Lite plan for free for the first month here: https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/cloud/free

Step 3 (IBM Cloud). Once you sign up and enter the main page of the IBM Cloud, you can then go to Catalog > click on speech to text (presented in a visual box)

Step 4 (IBM Cloud). It will then take you to a page where you can "Create" the service aka. Watson Speech to text. 

Step 5 (IBM Cloud). Go to Manage > find your API key and URL. We will use these information later on the Jupyter notebook. 

Step 6 (Anaconda). Launch Jupyter notebook on your computer.
Note: Terminal and your web browser will open here. 

Step 7 (Desktop). Make a new folder and save the file "Speech2text_IBMCloud.ipynb" which can be downloaded from this Github project (from me). 

Step 8 (Desktop). Save your audio file in the same folder as the .ipynb file. 

Step 9 (Jupyter notebook). Open "Speech2text_IBMCloud.ipynb". 

Step 10 (Jupyter notebook). Copy and paste the following information:
  a. API key you found on your IBM Cloud.
  b. URL found on your IBM Cloud.
  c. Audio file (ex. name_of_your_file.mp3)
  d. File name you would like to export (ex. name_of_your_file.text)

Step 11. Drink coffee or eat cake for 30 to 40 minutes to convert your file from audio to text (I had a long audio).
